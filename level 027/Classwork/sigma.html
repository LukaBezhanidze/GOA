        <h2>About Metal/Rock</h2>
        <p>
            Rock and metal music are two of the most influential and expressive genres in the world of music.
            Both share roots in blues and early rock and roll, but over time, they have evolved into distinct styles
            with their own cultures and sounds.

            "This I Love" is one of Guns N' Roses' most emotional and haunting ballads, featured on their *Chinese Democracy* album.
            The song delves into themes of heartbreak, longing, and the pain of lost love, with Axl Rose delivering powerful vocals
            layered over orchestral arrangements and a dramatic guitar solo.
